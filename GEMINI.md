# Vibe Builder Project Reference

## ⛔ CONTEXT OVERFLOW RECOVERY
**When context gets full or you feel lost in a long session:**
1. Re-read the vibe-builder skill: `.claude/skills/vibe-builder/SKILL.md`
2. Re-read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to check current progress
3. Re-read `TEST_PLAN.md` (if exists) to check test status
4. Follow the workflow strictly - especially the checkpoints below!

## ⚠️ WORKFLOW CHECKPOINTS (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP!)
| After Phase | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Phase 3 (Coding) complete | → Create TEST_PLAN.md → **⛔ STOP for Human review** |
| Phase 4 (Test Plan) approved | → Execute tests autonomously |
| Phase 5 (Testing) complete | → Report results → Enter Phase 6 loop |

**CRITICAL:** After finishing ALL coding tasks, you MUST:
1. Create TEST_PLAN.md
2. **⛔ STOP and wait for Human approval**
3. DO NOT run any tests until Human reviews TEST_PLAN.md!

- `TEST_PLAN.md` - Test cases and results (created in Phase 4)

## Coding Guidelines
- Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for tasks
- Use typed language as specified in PRD.md (Javascript in this case is loosely typed, but use JSDoc where helpful)
- Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
- Keep code minimal and focused
